This project was for processing large extents of the WA state.
To determine potentially suitable area to harvest wild sandalwood stands.

The dataset were quite large.
Plenty of polygon to raster rasterisation using both gdal and rasterio
Also with some standard numpy raster calculations, typically np.where()

rioxarray was also used in a simplistic way.

There are plenty of code snippets to be found in here.
